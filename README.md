# AGI-SCI-index
### Official Sierra Game version and Interpreter version, AGI and SCI, PC only.

This index is based on my experiences as a Sierra games-loving translator,
but also on the games referenced by AGI Programmers Wiki, SCI Programmers Wiki,
ScummVM detection tables, Sluicebox's sci-scripts and SCIprogramming specialists.

I'd like to take this opportunity to say a friendly hello to Chris Benshoof, aka Sluicebox,
that guy Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth young of the SCI engine.

Special thanks to Collector for his Sierra Version Tool software.

I'd also like to say hello to friends of the translation forums,
Abandonware-forums.org by Abandonware France, AbandonSocios.org,
OldGamesItalia.ne, Forum.Arena80.it, Compiware-forum.de, Old-Games.ru, etc...

Many thanks to Doomlazer, friend, teammate and Sierra games enthusiast!

For games marked "tested", I have personally verified the game and interpreter versions.
Games marked "Missing" are listed by other resources, but I was not personally able to 
verify their existence.

About interpreter version x.yyy.yyy, Collector's note:
"The int guess comes from the SVM hash tables. there are a number
of interpreters that did not have a proper version number.
A number of interpreters ID as "x.yyy.zzz".
I suspect that this was a place holder for the actual version
that was not updated to what it should have been before the build.
The SVM guess is probably based on features and how it reads game data."

Note: At the time, VGA and EGA were indicated on the blue Front Cover label.
The EGA mode (or LOWRES compared with VGA release) made it possible to run the game on low-capacity computers.
Some boxes clearly state that VGA and EGA versions are sold separately.
Some EGA editions even have separate version and interpreter numbers from the VGA edition.

Note from ScummVM detection tables: Shivers 2 doesn't contain SCI scripts. The whole game logic has been reimplemented from SCI in native code placed in DLL files. Each room has its own DLL file, and some SCI functions have been  reimplemented/rewritten for this purpose in native code. The game and demo have all the resources of a SCI game, apart from  the SCI scripts themselves. Thus, they cannot be directly supported, unless their whole room logic is rewritten from scratch, which classifies Shivers 2 as "not SCI".

There are two games, which I don't know if they exist in French or not,
Police Quest III and Quest for Glory IV on floppy disk.
There's an old Sierra & Coktel Vision advert that says they do, but nothing is less certain.

To my knowledge, the Czech, Israeli, Korean and Chinese Taiwanese editions have not been translated. They are the original English versions.

It's always possible to add lots of details for each game version, but my aim was to make the index as sober as possible.

This index is subject to evolved and may undergo corrections. Feel free to add your comments.
The aim is to identify existing or as yet unknown games, in order to save resources.

Sometimes you'll find the same Game Version numbers and version Interpreter numbers with the same or different hashes, but the game's root resources will look different. They're the exact same resources, merely spread out differently. The hash for the map file is different because the spread is different. Have no doubt about it. This with the fact the game source contains bat files and makevols scripts to create both "360" and "720" versions. For example, an "overnite.bat" file that does everything short of actually copying things to diskettes, for both four and eight disk versions. Hence the name. They're "nightly builds", and they come in both 5.25" and 3.5", from the exact same resources.

A small detail to bear in mind for potential translators, or for any other project.
All Sierra games are more or less buggy. There are no exceptions!
It may be a simple error in the code that prevents a phrase or action from being displayed, or it may be a serious crash.
For Talkie games, dubbing is sometimes missing. In other words, there's a lot of work to be done.
